Q1:

a:
(185)_10 -> base 4

185/4 quotient: 46, remainder: 1 
46/4 quotient: 11, remainder: 2
11/4 quotient: 2, remainder: 3
2/4 quotient: 0, remainder: 2

(185)_10 -> (2321)_4

b: 
(1110_0101)_2s -> decimal

1. Realize negative sign because of 1 at the front.

2. Transform to positive version:
1110_0101 -> 0001_1010 -> 0001_1011

3. Transform to decimal:
0001_1011 ->
1 * 2^0 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 ->
1 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 27

4. Write as a negative decimal number and done:
Answer: (-27)_10

Q2:

n = left my notes in the library
r = finished the rought draft
b = i revised the bibliography

n or r
-n or b
r or b

B. Resolution

Q3: 
B. 

Q4:
¬((¬q → ¬p) ∧ (q → ¬p))
¬((¬¬q ∨ ¬p) ∧ (q → ¬p)) 
¬(q ∨ ¬p) ∨ ¬(¬q ∨ ¬p)
(¬q ∧ p) ∨ (q ∧ p)

D. p

Q5:
B.

Q6:
C

Q7:
B, C, and D

Q8:
B and C

Q9:
a true, the empty set is a subset of every set. 
b true
c true
d false
e true

f false
g true
h false
i true, the empty set is a subset of every set.
j false

Q10:
A: one to one and onto.

If x is a subseteq of a then i can get every single set of the powerset of a by subtracting subsets from a.
For the empty set i get it easy with subtracting a itself. then for the whole set i get it by subtracting the emptyset.
And so on. So it's deifnitely onto.
But then, it's also one to one because no matter what value we choose for X, if the values are different,
they will map to a diffferent set in the powerset of A. 

Q11:

f: ZZ -> ZZ, x^2 + 1
g: ZZ -> ZZ, 3x + 2

g ο f = g(f(x))

3(x^2 + 1) + 2

3x^2 + 3 + 2 -> 3x^2 + 5

B.

Q12:
bar{A} ∩ (A ∪ B)
(\eset)  ∪ (bar{A} ∩ B)
(bar{A} ∩ B)
D.
